{"name":"Orthogonal Matching Pursuit 2D in Java","tagline":"OMP2D ImageJ Plugin","body":"### Orthogonal Matching Pursuit 2D in Java.\r\nFor more information on the OMP2D algorithm see [this paper](#) \r\n\r\n### Installing the plugin for ImageJ\r\n1. First Download the ImageJ application from [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html) and the OMP2D plugin from [here](https://github.com/simonsm1/OMP2D/raw/master/OMP2D/OMP2D_Plugin.jar)\r\n2. Extract ImageJ to a folder of your choice and copy OMP2D_Plugin.jar to the plugins folder within.\r\n3. Launch the ImageJ executable and you should find OMP2D listed under the plugins menu.\r\n\r\nor if you're running 64-bit Linux\r\n```\r\nwget http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download/linux/ij147-linux64.zip\r\nunzip ij147-linux64.zip\r\nwget -P ImageJ/plugins https://github.com/simonsm1/OMP2D/raw/master/OMP2D/OMP2D_Plugin.jar\r\n./ImageJ/ImageJ\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Supported Images\r\nThis plugin currently supports greyscale images which are exactly divisble by 32. See example image below:\r\n\r\n![Astro 512](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonsm1/OMP2D/master/OMP2D/Astro_512_grey.jpg)\r\n\r\n### About\r\nThis Plugin was developed by Matt Simons of Aston University for his Undergrad Mathematics Project see report for further details \r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\nWith thanks to [Laura Robollo-Neira](http://www.aston.ac.uk/eas/staff/a-z/dr-laura-rebollo-neira/) for supervising and support this project.
